Title: Using batch files as the task runner in Visual Studio Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) allows you specify tasks which can be in a task runner. Most examples
I've seen show how to integrate with Javascript task runners such as Gulp. There is no reason why you can't simpley use
batch files though.

An example tasks.json:

```js
{
	"version": "0.1.0",
	"command": "${workspaceRoot}/runTask.bat",
	"isShellCommand": true,
	"showOutput": "always",
	"args": [],
	"tasks": [
		{
			"taskName": "build",
			"isBuildCommand": true,
			"showOutput": "always"
		},
		{
			"taskName": "serve",
			"showOutput": "never"
		}
	]
}
```

This sets the batch file "runTask.bat" in the root of your workspace as the task runner. There are two tasks
which can be started: "build" and "serve". "build" can be started with "ctrl+shift+T" and "serve" can be
started via "ctrl+shift+P" and typing "run task". I like to map this shortcut to "ctrl+shift+R".

Here is how runTask.bat should look:

```bat
@ECHO OFF

IF "%1" == "build" GOTO BUILD
IF "%1" == "serve" GOTO SERVE
GOTO UNKNOWN

:BUILD
CALL build.bat
GOTO END

:SERVE
START serve.bat
GOTO END

:UNKNOWN
ECHO Unknown Task
GOTO END

:END
```
