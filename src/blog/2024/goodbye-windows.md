I finally did it. All the computers in my house are now running [debian](https://www.debian.org/) except for the office PC. I've
used Windows for at least 30 years but over the last few years it's become more and more user hostile. After the latest
[Windows Recall](https://github.com/xaitax/TotalRecall) push and the security implications surrounding it, I decided I could no longer
keep running Windows on all the machines in my house.

Fox my linux distribution I went with [debian](https://www.debian.org/) because I want my machines to just work&trade;. I don't really know
what to think about [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) and their snap packages and while I tried [fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/) and was initially
impressed, I found that a few things subtley didn't work. [debian](https://www.debian.org/) seems to be super stable with packages in `apt` and for
anything where I need the latest and greatest I just install it by hand or build it from source. It's a boring distribution but I see that
as a good thing.

I even installed it on my gaming PC and now have a console like experience up and running on it. I only enabled the "non-free" repos in
[debian](https://www.debian.org/) and everything seems to work well enough even though I have an nVidia graphics card in it. I think only
the open source nVidia driver is installed and not the proprietary one from nVidia but so far I haven't noticed any major problems. I found
one game that wouldn't work from my Steam collection so far but that's it.
