Title: All the cool kids are static

Seems like all the cool kids these days have converted their websites to completely static ones. I'm looking at you [Mr. Haacked](http://haacked.com). I thought this was a pretty cool idea and a chance
to really refresh my website so I decided to take a stab at it. It's currently a work in progress.

I ended up writing my own tool I call [Gatsby](http://github.com/smack0007/Gatsby) to do it. I also set up the whole deploy process myself involving pushing to [Github](http://github.com/smack0007/zacharysnow.net)
which then informs my website to pull from the Github repository. Hopefully that will be a blog post in the not too distance future.

Sorry for any inconvenience.
