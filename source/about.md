I'm an American programmer and father currently living in Soest, Germany. I work for [Beumer Group](https://www.beumergroup.com/).
Most of my time I'm living in the C# / .NET world. From time to time I dabble in web programming. With my hobby time I focus
on graphics programming using OpenGL thru C#.
