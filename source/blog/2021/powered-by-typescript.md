Over the past couple of years my career has moved more and more torwards me becoming
a frontend developer. Since 2018 I've basically been a TypeScript programmer professionally
and the language has really grown on me. Over the last couple of days I've had some
down time so I decided now was the time to reprogram the blog in TypeScript.

The site is still a static site but the compiler is a now a custom TypeScript program. The
size of the program is now considerably smaller but that isn't necessarily becuase C# was
bad but rather that this is the 2nd implementation and I know what I did and did not need.
