I've always wanted a program that would allow me have a command line that I could slide in and out of view as needed like the console from [Quake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_(video_game)). I never could find one and so I finally got decided to write a tool myself. A picture is below and the source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/smack0007/WinQuakeCon).

I'm not putting a download here as I don't consider this finished just yet.
