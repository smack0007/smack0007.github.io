I haven't written anything new here in a very long time and a lot has happened since then. I started a new job at
[BeumerGroup](https://www.beumergroup.com) this year and now work mostly in TypeScript writing an html5 spa app.

In my spare time I've decided to working on version 2.0 of my [Snowball](https://github.com/smack0007/Snowball),
my 2D game framework. I've been playing around with the idea for a while now. This version will be developed directly
for .net core and will be developed with cross platform capability in mind. The api will look similar but will have
some changes.

The old repo is still available on my [github](https://github.com/smack0007/) at [https://github.com/smack0007/Snowball_v1](https://github.com/smack0007/Snowball_v1).
