I finally brought Component Glue up to a state where I felt like the product was finished. You can get it via NuGet:

<div class="nuget-badge">
`PM&gt; Install-Package ComponentGlue`
</div>

or you can get the source from [GitHub](https://github.com/smack0007/ComponentGlue). The documentation is definitely sparse I know but I recommend taking a look at the unit tests to get a feel for what you can do with Component Glue.
