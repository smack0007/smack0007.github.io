Today I released a project I've been playing around with for a year or so on Codeplex. It's called [GLDotNet](https://gldotnet.codeplex.com/). From the project description:

*C# wrapper for OpenGL. Partially generated from the OpenGL spec and partially written by hand, the aim is to have a flexible and native feeling C# binding.*

I have generated functions from the OpenGL spec excluding 1 or 2 but unfortunately of the generated code is untested. There is a demo project included in the source code. The Github repository is located here: [https://github.com/smack0007/GLDotNet](https://github.com/smack0007/GLDotNet)
