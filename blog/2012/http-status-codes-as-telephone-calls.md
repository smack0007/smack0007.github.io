I had a funny idea to describe HTTP Status Codes as telephone conversations so I thought I'd write it in a blog post.

<dl>
<dt>301</dt>
<dd>She's not here right now but she'll be back later.</dd>

<dt>302</dt>
<dd>She doesn't live here anymore, she now lives somewhere else.</dd>

<dt>304</dt>
<dd>He hesn't changed a bit.</dd>

<dt>401</dt>
<dd>I can't allow you to speak to him.</dd>

<dt>402</dt>
<dd>$1.99 for the first minute...</dd>

<dt>404</dt>
<dd>No one by that name lives here.</dd>

<dt>500</dt>
<dd>It's not you, it's me.</dd>

<dt>503</dt>
<dd>I can't deal with this anymore.</dd>
</dl>
